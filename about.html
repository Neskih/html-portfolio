<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! I am a driven and determined individual, a proud mother of two, with a strong will to achieve my dreams and set an inspiring example for my children. My journey is fueled by my unwavering dedication and a resilient character that motivates me to overcome challenges. I’m passionate about creating something meaningful that reflects my values and ambitions.</p>

<p>Currently, I’m working towards becoming a professional web developer, following an intensive masterclass to gain a comprehensive understanding of full-stack development. I aspire to build my own web development business to complement my beauty salon, an important project that holds a special place in my heart. This unique combination will allow me to express my creativity and connect with people in impactful ways.</p>

<p>Beyond my professional goals, I have a deep love for Moroccan cuisine and culture. I dream of marrying someone who shares this cultural connection, and one day, if Allah wills, I hope to visit Morocco and experience its beauty firsthand. My family and heritage are important parts of my life and constantly inspire me to grow.</p>

<p>As a multilingual speaker fluent in French, Dutch, and English, I enjoy connecting with people from diverse backgrounds. I prefer speaking French, as it feels most natural, and I’m always open to learning new things. My energy, ambition, and passion for growth are what drive me to pursue excellence in all I do, especially as I work toward building a future that brings together my personal and professional dreams.</p>
